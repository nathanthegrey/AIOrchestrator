/// THE HOOK THAT STOPS A SESSION STOPPING.
///
/// The owner told sessions to run an endeavour to the end, repeatedly, and they kept stopping —
/// *"no matter how many times i tell it not to get stuck and keep going, it will keep getting stuck,
/// so I fear the solution we implemented might not be enough"* (2026-08-20). They were right: the
/// solution was prose in a role command, and prose is exactly what had already failed.
///
/// The ledger hook next door had already written the principle down: *"The difference is
/// enforcement, not diligence."* This exercises the enforcement rather than reading it — the bash
/// half cannot be reached from C# any other way, and the ONE bug this hook shipped with (a `grep -c`
/// that prints 0 and exits 1, so `|| echo 0` produced "0 0" and a finished ledger blocked) was found
/// by running it, never by reading it.
///
/// Nothing here skips. If bash is missing the test FAILS: a harness that cannot run what it tests
/// must not certify it.
