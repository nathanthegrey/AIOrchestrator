/// THE WIRING, which two of us declared unpinnable and a reviewer then pinned.
///
/// The feature is not the reader or the prompt — it is WHAT A CLOSE-IMPLEMENTER REQUEST DOES when it
/// lands. That was "parks for the owner's tap" until 2026-08-13 and is "closes the member" since;
/// this file kept its name and its harness across that reversal, and each case says which side of it
/// the case belongs to. The decision lives in <c>BridgeEngineModel</c>, which is
/// <c>internal sealed</c> with no <c>InternalsVisibleTo</c>, so it was written off as reachable only
/// through a timing-dependent test of the kind that fails one run in seven and teaches everyone to
/// re-run it. That was an assumption, and nobody measured it.
///
/// NOT COVERED HERE, stated rather than left to be discovered: the tap-refusal branch in the confirmed
/// -close handler — the one that must NOT be deleted as unreachable, because its <c>else</c> ends the
/// whole orchestration. Reaching it needs a live confirmation registration, which needs the Telegram
/// client this harness deliberately does not have. It becomes testable through the injection seam
/// imp-1 built on the R1 branch, and until then it is verified by reading the diff, which is weaker
/// and is why it is written down here.
///
/// EVERY FLAKE REASON ASSUMED HERE TURNS OUT TO BE CHECKABLE, and the reviewer checked them:
/// <c>BridgeEngine_Factory.Create</c> takes interfaces only and the spawner fake already exists, so
/// nothing is spawned; a temp root carries no config, so the Telegram client is null and no network
/// is touched; the tick calls <c>Process_PendingRequests</c> as its FIRST statement before any await,
/// so the parking happens synchronously on this thread; with no Telegram client the ask returns on
/// its fail-closed path, so the parked file STAYS parked — a stable end state with nothing to race;
/// and killing a pid file that does not exist is a no-op.
///
/// It costs nothing in production. The harness is the same shape as the launcher tests.
