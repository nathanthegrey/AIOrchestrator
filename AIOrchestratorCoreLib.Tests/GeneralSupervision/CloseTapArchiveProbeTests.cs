/// THE PROPERTY, NOT THE STRUCTURE: a confirmed tap ARCHIVES the parked request, on the path where the
/// close ran and on the path where it threw — and the two records say different things.
///
/// It is written against the behaviour because the structure has already moved once. The archive lived
/// in a `finally`, which was deleted: the catch above swallows without rethrowing and the try body has
/// no return, so fall-through already guaranteed what the `finally` claimed to, and a `finally` that
/// guarantees nothing is pure risk surface — it was the one place a throwing call could replace an
/// exception still in flight. But "the try body has no return" is a fact about the code TODAY. Add an
/// early return later, for a perfectly good reason, and archiving is silently skipped with nothing
/// failing. These cases fail.
///
/// AND THE ENGINE IS REACHABLE, which is the part I had wrong. `BridgeEngineModel` is `internal sealed`
/// with no `InternalsVisibleTo`, so a rule DECIDED inside it cannot be asserted directly — but
/// `BridgeEngine_Factory` is public and takes interfaces only, so its EFFECTS can be observed through
/// the front door. <see cref="CloseImplementerGuardProbeTests"/> established that and its own summary
/// says two members had declared the same wiring unpinnable first.
