/// <summary>
/// THE PAIR THE WATCHDOG'S OWN COMMENT WARNS ABOUT, and it decides whether promotion can exist at
/// all.
///
/// A basic orchestration never had a supervisor, so checking for one would respawn a supervisor into
/// it forever, on top of the solo session that IS the orchestration. That is why the check was there.
/// But it read the MEMBER IDS — basic meant "some member id starts with solo-" — and member ids are
/// kept forever as an audit trail, closed ones included. So promoting an orchestration by closing its
/// solo and spawning a supervisor left it reading as basic FOR EVER: the promoted supervisor would
/// never be respawned when it died, silently, with everything else working.
///
/// Filtering closed members does not fix it either. An empty roster reads as NOT basic, so a basic
/// orchestration whose solo had been closed would flip to full and the watchdog would spawn a
/// supervisor into it — the exact failure the comment exists to prevent, arrived at from the other
/// side. The derivation had no way to express "promoted", which is what forced the change.
///
/// `SupervisorSpawnedUtc` answers the question the watchdog is actually asking — is there a
/// supervisor slot to protect here — rather than answering a question about members and hoping it
/// correlates. It is already persisted and it is stamped BEFORE the spawn is attempted, on purpose.
///
/// THIS HARNESS DRIVES THE REAL WATCHDOG. The launcher, the store and the paths are real; only the
/// process spawner is faked, exactly as OrchestrationLauncherTests does. So these are not assertions
/// about a helper — they are assertions about what the watchdog does.
