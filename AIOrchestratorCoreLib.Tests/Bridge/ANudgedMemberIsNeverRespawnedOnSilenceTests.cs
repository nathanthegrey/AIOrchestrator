// SERIALISED WITH THE CHANNEL-LOCK CLASSES, because this one starts a real engine and
// BridgeEngineModel.Run_Async rewires the PROCESS-WIDE ChannelLock_Diagnostics sink on every
// start. A class that does that while ChannelLockDiagnosticsTests is mid-assertion steals its
// captured lines, and the theft is reported as that class's failure. 31 other classes start an
// engine outside this collection and have the same effect; enrolling them all was MEASURED at
// 6m26s against a 1m35s baseline — a 4x cost on every run, refused. This one is enrolled
// because it is the thief this session added, and removing it costs nothing.
