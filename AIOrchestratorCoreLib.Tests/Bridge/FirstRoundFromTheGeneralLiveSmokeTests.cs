/// the owner would have typed into is made by the greeting the supervisor had not written). Both are
/// fixed; this is the proof that they are fixed TOGETHER, which is the only way either of them is
/// worth anything. Two engines' worth of unit tests can both be green and the round still stop at the
/// seam between them.

/// WHAT IS REAL HERE: the <c>claude</c> CLI on <c>--model haiku</c>, the request-file protocol, the
