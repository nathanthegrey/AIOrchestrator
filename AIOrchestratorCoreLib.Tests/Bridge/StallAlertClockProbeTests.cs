/// THE OWNER'S STALL ALERT, AND THE WRITE THAT USED TO SILENCE IT WAS THE APP'S OWN (rev-7's F1).
///
/// `Send_StallAlerts_Async` asks how long an orchestration has been quiet. That question used to be
/// answered by the newest FILE stamp across the owner channel and every member channel, so anything
/// that touched a file marked the whole orchestration alive without a word being said — a compaction's
/// rename-over, a request confirmation, a `/resume`. The sharpest case is self-referential: **the
/// supervisor nudge the engine fires itself** lands in the owner channel, and that write told the
/// stall detector everything was fine. A liveness signal its own alarm resets is not a liveness
/// signal.
///
/// The fixture is exactly that shape: a member's report unanswered for forty minutes, and an app entry
/// in the owner channel stamped NOW with the owner channel's file stamped to match. Under the file
/// reading the orchestration looks like it spoke a moment ago; under the conversation reading it has
/// been silent for forty minutes and the owner is owed an alert.
///
/// It needs a Telegram client because `Send_StallAlerts_Async` returns immediately without one — so
/// this test is only possible at all through `Create_WithTelegramClient`, the seam that does not exist
/// on the branches based before it.
/// </summary>
// EVERY FIXTURE'S OWNER-CHANNEL ENTRY IS A REAL QUESTION, and that is not incidental to these
// probes: since 2026-09-09 the stall alert fires only when the supervisor's last owner-channel
// entry is a declared question (`QUESTION:` or `BLOCKED ON OWNER`), once per question. What THESE
// tests are about is the QUIET CLOCK — which channels date an orchestration as alive — so each one
// supplies the debt the alert now requires and then measures the clock, exactly as before.
