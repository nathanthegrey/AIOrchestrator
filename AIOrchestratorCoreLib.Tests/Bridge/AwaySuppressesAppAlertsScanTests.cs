/// AWAY MODE MUST ACTUALLY SUPPRESS SOMETHING — the finding behind the 2026-08-19 fix.
///
/// Before it, `Is_AwayMode()` had four call sites in the whole library: two topic-name glyph
/// renders, one that ADDED the 30-minute digest, and the getter. It gated ZERO outbound messages.
/// So `AwayMode_Policy.AWAY_ON_NOTICE`'s promise — *"will not ask you anything else"* — was kept
/// only by the per-orchestration QUIET state, which does not cover the app's OWN alerts, and the
/// owner woke to about 33 messages.
///
/// Driving the engine into away mode from a test needs fifteen minutes of owner silence and a
/// tracker already quiet, with no seam to force either — so this pins the wiring by reading the
/// source, the same shape as <c>MemoKeyCompositionScanTests</c>. It is a WEAKER claim than an
/// integration test and is written down as such: it proves the gate is present and placed, not that
/// it fires. <see cref="AwayDigestDeciderTests"/> carries the behavioural half.
///
/// It also pins the away DECISION's wiring, for the same reason and by the same means: on
/// 2026-09-07 the owner reported away mode declaring them absent while they sat at a terminal with
/// `/pc` set, and the fix is a flag the pure policy cannot prove anybody passes it.
