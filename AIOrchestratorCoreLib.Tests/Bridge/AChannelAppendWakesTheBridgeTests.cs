/// Measured on the VPS on 2026-09-09: 11–12 s median from the owner's Telegram message to their
/// supervisor's turn starting. One of those seconds was the mirror tick — <c>MIRROR_TICK_MILLISECONDS</c>
/// is 2000, so anything appended to a channel file waits on average a second, and up to two, before the
/// loop looks at it. It is paid TWICE on the owner's path, because the tick that writes their message
/// into the channel is not the tick that hands it to the dispatcher.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The owner's decision was to react to the change and keep the tick as the safety net. A
/// <c>ChannelChangeWaker</c> watches the supervision root for <c>*.md</c> writes and the loop
/// waits on the tick OR the watcher, whichever comes first, so the tick is a ceiling rather than a
/// quantum. A wake also carries the two short settling polls the tailer needs to release a trailing
/// entry (<c>ChannelTailerModel.QUIET_POLLS_TO_FLUSH</c>) — without them the notification would only
/// have bought the first of the three ticks this path used to cost.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// HOW THE MEASUREMENT IS MADE HONEST. The first append is mirrored and OBSERVED, which is the moment a
/// tick has just finished — so the next tick is a full 2 s away. The second append is made right there,
/// and it must reach Telegram in well under a second. Without a watcher that is impossible: the loop is
/// asleep for the rest of the tick and nothing else wakes it.
