/// THE TEST A3.2 COULD NOT BE, and the reason it could not: <see cref="DecisionStateSurvivesARestartTests"/>
/// drives two engines over ONE IN-MEMORY store, deliberately — the property it pins is "the second
/// engine reads what the first wrote", and a real file would add a second thing that can fail without
/// adding anything to that assertion. It is a good decision and it is still a good decision. But it
/// means the suite's one restart acceptance test never touched <see cref="FileEngineStateStoreModel"/>,
/// never wrote a byte, and could be green on a build where nothing ever reached the disk at all.
///
/// <para>
/// WHAT MADE THAT GAP WORTH CLOSING. On the VPS on 2026-09-06 the daemon was killed with a decision
/// pending and <c>.engine-state.json</c> was found holding <c>"pendingButtons": []</c>, its mtime nine
/// minutes older than the buttons on the owner's phone. That decision turns out to have been a CLOSE
/// CONFIRMATION, which is a separate registry that is deliberately not persisted at all (its durable
/// record is the parked request file) — so the file was right and the alarm was about the wrong
/// family. But nothing in the suite could have told anyone that, because no test had ever asserted
/// that a question with options reaches the disk under the store the daemon actually runs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So this is the same journey as A3.2 — question, buttons, kill, restart, tap — with two changes that
/// are the whole point: the FILE store, and a SECOND store instance built fresh over the same path, so
/// the second engine can only know what is genuinely on disk.
