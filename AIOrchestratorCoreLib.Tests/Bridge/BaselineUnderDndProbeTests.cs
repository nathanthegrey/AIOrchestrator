/// Both sweeps run BELOW the DND gate, and orchestrations can still be CREATED under DND. So a channel
/// born during a mute was first SEEN at unmute, hours later, with everything that had accumulated in it

/// reason. The only observable difference between fixed and unfixed is an offence that ARRIVES DURING
/// THE MUTE: unfixed it is absorbed with the history and lost, fixed it is new and reported. That case
/// is the guard; this one is kept because a pass that recorded SIGHT WITHOUT READING would redden it,
