/// <summary>
/// AN OWNER MODE COMMAND MUST REACH TELEGRAM EVEN WHEN THE APP THINKS THERE IS NOTHING TO DO.
///
/// The topic-name sync keeps an in-memory note of the last name it applied, so the periodic tick
/// does not spend an API call every two seconds saying the same thing. That memo is right almost
/// always — but when it is wrong it is wrong in the one direction that cannot heal, because being
/// wrong means SKIPPING, and every later tick agrees there is nothing to do.
///
/// It can be wrong two ways, both live: the map was written by two loops with no ordering (the
/// mirror tick and the inbound command loop both call the sync), and a genuine Telegram refusal
/// records the refused name as applied on purpose.
///
/// The owner, 2026-08-24, on a topic switched back to Normal six minutes earlier with no sync error
/// in the log: *"the topic still has the moon even though I removed the DND"*.
///
/// So this pins the rule that makes their action reliable regardless of what the memo believes: a
/// command they typed by hand always re-pushes. The case chosen is the one where the memo and the
/// wanted name AGREE — /unmute on a topic already Normal — because that is the only shape where the
/// old code takes the skip, and therefore the only shape that can tell the fix from its absence.
