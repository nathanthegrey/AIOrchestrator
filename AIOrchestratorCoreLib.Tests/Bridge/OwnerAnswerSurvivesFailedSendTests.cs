/// R1 — THE OWNER'S ANSWER MUST SURVIVE A FAILED SEND.
///
/// The owner asks something; the supervisor answers; the Telegram send fails. The append is left
/// UNCONFIRMED on purpose so the tailer re-emits it — that retry is the whole safety net. But the
/// "the owner is waiting for an answer" flag was consumed BEFORE the send, so on the re-emission the
/// very same entry re-evaluated as ordinary narration and `OwnerPush_Policy` suppressed it. The
/// answer to a question the owner actually asked was dropped silently, with nothing anywhere saying
/// so. The owner reported exactly this once.
///
/// WHY THIS TEST IS SHAPED THE EXPENSIVE WAY. Two constraints in the engine leave no cheaper honest
/// option, and both were verified in the source before this file was written:
///
///   - `Mirror_Append_Async` returns early when there is no Telegram client, ABOVE the code under
///     test. A file-only harness — which every other engine test uses — cannot reach this defect at
///     all, so the send must come from a fake client that can be made to fail.
///   - `Is_MirrorAttemptDue` holds a failed channel back for MIRROR_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS (30), and
///     the waiting flag is per-instance in-memory state. So both attempts must happen on the SAME
///     engine, 30 s apart. A fresh engine starts with an empty flag set and would go red with or
///     without the fix — a green that pins nothing.
///
/// THE ANSWER TEXT CARRIES NO QUESTION MARK, NO QUESTION:/OPTION: MARKER AND NO BLOCKED MARKER, on
/// purpose: under `OwnerPush_Policy.Should_Push` that leaves exactly ONE route to it being pushed —
/// the owner waiting. An answer that would push on its own merits would keep this test green with the
/// flag cleared, which is the "two routes to the asserted state" trap.
