/// <summary>
/// THE PRODUCER OF THE TYPED EXCEPTION, PINNED — the half `TelegramAttemptGateTests` is blind to.
///
/// `Classify_Failure` is pinned six ways: it is a pure function and the suite hammers it. But it can
/// only classify what it is HANDED, and nothing asserted that the client hands it a
/// <see cref="AIOrchestratorCoreLib.Telegram.TelegramApiClient.TelegramApiException"/> at all. rev-11
/// measured the gap: revert all four status-bearing throw sites to a plain `Exception` — the exact
/// pre-fix state — and the suite stays at 709 passed, 0 failed. Not one test moves.
///
/// The failure that makes it worth pinning NOW is not generic: a merge resolution on one of the 23 live
/// branches turns one throw back into a plain `Exception`, topic sync silently returns to "one 429 pins
/// a stale glyph until restart", and the suite is green. We are about to do that merge.
///
/// WHY THIS ASSERTS SOURCE TEXT, WHICH IS NORMALLY THE WRONG INSTRUMENT. A behavioural test would need
/// the client to be reachable and its transport substitutable: `TelegramApiClientModel` is
/// `internal sealed` with no `InternalsVisibleTo`, it constructs its own `HttpClient` in its
/// constructor, and it builds `https://api.telegram.org/...` inline. There is no seam, and adding one
/// is a production change this test was explicitly scoped not to make.
///
/// The saving grace is that the property being protected IS a source-level property — WHICH EXCEPTION
/// TYPE IS CONSTRUCTED — and the hazard is a source-level edit during a merge. So this is not a proxy
/// for the real thing; it is the real thing, read where it is written. It is NOT a substitute for the
/// behavioural test: if the client ever gains a transport seam, that test should be written and this one
/// can go.
///
/// IT REFUSES TO RUN RATHER THAN PASS VACUOUSLY. A source-reading harness that cannot find its target
/// finds no offences either, and no-offences-is-a-pass is exactly how a guard certifies code it never
/// read (CLAUDE.md item 20). Locating the file is therefore asserted before anything is measured.
