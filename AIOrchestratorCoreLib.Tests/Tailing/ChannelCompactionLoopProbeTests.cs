/// THE DISCOVERY LOOP, DRIVEN BY THE REAL ENGINE — the half of compaction that
/// <see cref="AIOrchestratorCoreLib.Tailing.Channel_CompactionStep"/> deliberately does not contain,
/// and that nothing covered until this file. The step's own tests call `Compact_IfAllowed` directly
/// at ten sites; none of them asks whether anything ever CALLS it.
///
/// IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE REASON IT DID NOT WAS FALSE. Two production comments here stated that the
/// engine is "unreachable from a test" and "cannot be constructed from a test". Both are wrong:
/// `BridgeEngine_Factory.Create` is public, and five test files were already driving the engine when
/// those sentences were written. The claim began life true-SHAPED and narrow — nothing covered
/// `Compact_LongChannels` — and was carried outward as a fact about the type, into four briefs and
/// two comments, until it read as an instruction not to try. An honestly-declared gap resting on a
/// false premise is worse than an undeclared one, and this is the repair: the comments are corrected
/// in the same commit that proves them wrong.
///
/// ONE TICK IS ENOUGH, and the ordering is the whole reason it works. Within a single
/// `Execute_MirrorTick_Async` the tailer polls first (so `Was_PolledInLastPoll` answers yes), the
/// mirror pass then returns true in file-only mode — there is no phone to reach, so the entries are
/// as delivered as they will ever be — which confirms the append and clears the undelivered guard,
/// and only then does `Compact_LongChannels` run. Remove any one of those three and the channel is
/// not eligible.
