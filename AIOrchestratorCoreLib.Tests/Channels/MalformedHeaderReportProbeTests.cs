/// WHICH LINES THE ENGINE REPORTS, asserted through the real engine.
///
/// `Build_ReportBody` is well covered as a function, and every one of those tests passes while the
/// engine hands it `malformed` — every offending line in the file — instead of `unreported`, the ones
/// it has not already reported. That mutant compiles, runs, and was GREEN across the full suite: the
/// supervisor would be re-told about every historical malformed line on every new one, which is the
/// waterfall this repo keeps removing.
///
/// Same class as rev-7's I1 and I4: a call site choosing WHICH value to feed a tested helper, with the
/// helper's own tests structurally unable to see the choice.
///
/// The first-sight rule is load-bearing for the fixture and easy to get wrong: a channel is baselined
/// the first time it is seen WITH malformed lines (the count check precedes the baseline add), so the
/// first offender is absorbed silently as history and only the SECOND produces a report. The sequence
/// below is written around that rather than against it.
