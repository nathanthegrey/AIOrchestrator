/// answers to one question that has been re-argued from scratch twice: a well-formed header was
/// reported as malformed, and every hypothesis died because the only evidence was the line's TEXT.
/// Each occurrence has to carry its own proof; a formatter that produces the proof and a call site

/// WHY TWO TICKS. The first sight of a file is baselined SILENTLY, on purpose — a malformed header
/// from days ago cannot be usefully re-appended, and announcing history at every startup trains the
/// owner to ignore the warning that matters. So the first tick swallows the header that is already
/// there, and only a header that appears AFTER the app has seen the file is reported.
