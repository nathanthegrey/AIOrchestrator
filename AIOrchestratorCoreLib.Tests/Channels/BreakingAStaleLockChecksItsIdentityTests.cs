/// each breaker renames to its own <c>.broken.{guid}</c>, so two breakers never compete for a
/// destination — what stops the second is finding the SOURCE gone. The distinction matters because
/// it is the whole reason a window exists: staleness is judged, then the move happens, and a holder
/// that releases in between leaves a NEW writer's live lock to be broken instead. rev-6 measured 0
/// natural hits in 400 trials and reproduced it with a forced scheduling point.

/// THESE TESTS DO NOT RACE THE SCHEDULER, which is why they are worth having on a machine that

/// to hit by luck is constructed directly: passing a token that does not match the lock at the path
/// IS the state that race produces.
