/// THE NUDGE ACTUALLY FIRES — the assertion no unit test can make, because the decision is a pure
/// function and the CLOCK that feeds it is chosen at the call site.
///
/// `Measure_QuietFor` is pinned four ways in the unit tests and every one of them passes while the
/// engine hands it the wrong clock. On this machine `DateTime.UtcNow` against local stamps makes
/// `quietFor` NEGATIVE, so nothing ever reaches the nudge threshold and EVERY alarm in the system
/// goes quiet — with a green suite, because a defect that silences an alarm is invisible by
/// construction: nothing complains, since the complaining is what stopped.
///
/// This is the fourth appearance of one shape in a day — pin the CALL, not just the callee — and the
/// third time it hid in a seam built to make something testable.
///
/// WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated rather than left to be discovered: on a machine where local time IS
/// UTC, the mismatch has no effect and this test passes either way. It is not vacuous there — "a
/// dormant member gets nudged" is worth asserting on its own terms — but it stops being a guard
/// against the clock specifically. Verified on UTC+2.
