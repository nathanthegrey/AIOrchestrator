/// THE ENGINE USES THE KEY, asserted through the real engine — the half that unit tests structurally
/// cannot see.
///
/// `Build_FlagKey` is pinned four ways in IdleFlagKeyTests and every one of them passes while the
/// engine calls `Build_FlagBody` for its dedup key instead. That mutant COMPILES and RUNS — both take
/// the same argument and return a string — and it restores the shipped defect verbatim: the rendered
/// duration back inside the key, one flag per minute, 151 of them in six hours on 2026-08-13.
///
/// The defect never lived in the helper. It lived in which value the CALL SITE fed to the comparison,
/// and a fix that moves logic into a tested helper leaves that layer exactly as unpinned as it found
/// it. Same argument as GuardReportProbeTests in this branch — pin the CALL, not just the callee —
/// applied to the case that motivated the harness in the first place.
///
/// The clock is moved by REWRITING the declaration's stamp between ticks rather than by waiting: the
/// idle duration is computed from that stamp, so an older stamp renders a different duration with no
/// sleep and no flake.
