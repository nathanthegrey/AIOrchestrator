/// <summary>
/// ONE NUDGE PER UNANSWERED THING, driven through the real engine — because the gate is engine state
/// and a pure function cannot be asked about it.
///
/// The repetition was self-feeding and needed nobody: the app's nudge woke the member (its watcher
/// fingerprints the whole file), the waking proved it alive, that proof cleared the escalation map,
/// and the quiet clock its own write had restarted elapsed. A member that obeyed "silence is
/// acknowledgment" was nudged for obeying it, every 8 minutes, indefinitely.
///
/// ONLY ONE OF THE FOUR CHECKS LIVES HERE, AND A CONTROL RUN IS WHY. The other two engine-level ones
/// were written, run, and DELETED because the control refuted them:
///
///   "no second nudge while nothing new is said"  PASSED with the gate removed  -> vacuous
///   "a new entry earns its own nudge"            FAILED with the gate removed  -> not the gate
///
/// Both are governed by something older: after a nudge, `_nudgedMemberUtc` holds the member and the
/// escalation branch returns for ORPHAN_CONFIRM_MINUTES, so within that window NOTHING can nudge
/// again — with or without this fix. The gate's effect only becomes observable after the alive probe
/// clears that map six minutes later, which no fast test can reach.
///
/// So the DECISION is pinned pure, in NudgeDeciderTests, and the wiring is not. The fourth check — a
/// dead member still escalating — is verified at the diff and reported as such: the escalation
/// branch, the probe and `_nudgedMemberUtc` are untouched, and the first nudge still records its
/// timestamp. A stated limit beats a test that passes for another reason, which is what two of these
/// were doing before the control was run.
