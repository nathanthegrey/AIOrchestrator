/// AN APP WRITE MUST NOT DELAY THE FIRST NUDGE — the one defect the quiet clock still fixes on
/// current master, driven through the real engine because the delay is a property of the CALL.
///
/// WHY THIS ONE AND NOT THE LOOP. The self-feeding repetition this clock was originally written for
/// is already dead: <see cref="AIOrchestratorCoreLib.Status.Nudge_Decider.Identify_LastConversationEntry_OrNull"/>
/// remembers WHICH entry a member was nudged about, that memory is never cleared, and the app's own
/// writes never change the last conversation entry — so no second nudge can be issued for the same
/// unanswered thing whatever the clock says. Asserting the loop here would therefore pass with the
/// clock reverted, which is precisely how two engine-level tests in
/// <see cref="NudgeOncePerThingProbeTests"/> were written, run, refuted by their control, and deleted.
///
/// What survives that control is the FIRST nudge. Scheduled from the file's write stamp, any app
/// write landing after the unanswered entry restarts the clock — so a member that has been genuinely
/// stalled for twenty minutes is not woken because the app itself touched the file one minute ago.
///
/// THE FILE STAMP IS SET TO NOW ON PURPOSE, and it is what stops this passing for another reason: the
/// old behaviour reads "quiet for ~0" from that stamp and cannot nudge, so a nudge here can only have
/// come from reading the last CONVERSATION entry.
