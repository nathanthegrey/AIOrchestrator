/// <summary>
/// TWO CLOCKS READ A MEMBER'S CHANNEL AND ONLY ONE WAS CONVERTED. The member nudge moved onto the
/// conversation stamp; the SUPERVISOR nudge — the one that reports which members are waiting on a
/// verdict — kept reading the file's write stamp, so every app write to a member's channel silenced
/// it for the full threshold. That is the same defect
/// <see cref="NudgeAppWriteDelayProbeTests"/> pins one path over, and it survived because the fix was
/// described by the clock it changed rather than by the clocks that existed.
///
/// COMPACTION IS THE REASON THIS IS NOT MERELY A DELAY WORTH SHRUGGING AT. It rewrites a live channel
/// through a rename-over, so the file's stamp advances with NOBODY HAVING SPOKEN — no entry added, no
/// conversation moved. Under a file-stamp clock the supervisor is then told nothing is waiting, on a
/// channel where a report has been sitting unanswered for twenty minutes. `/resume` does the same
/// thing on purpose and unboundedly: it has no dedupe, so each broadcast re-silenced this path.
///
/// THE FILE STAMP IS SET TO NOW ON PURPOSE, and it is what makes the first case specific: under the
/// old behaviour that stamp reads "quiet for ~0" and no nudge can fire, so a nudge here can only have
/// come from reading the last conversation entry.
///
/// SCHEDULED AND GATED, NOT A COVERAGE GAP — and the distinction is the point. The mtime FALLBACK
/// inside <see cref="AIOrchestratorCoreLib.Status.Nudge_Decider.Measure_QuietFor"/> still fails
/// SILENT when a stamp cannot be trusted, against a docstring promising it fails noisy. It is
/// reachable and it is testable, by this very harness; it is not done here because it MUST NOT LAND
/// before the app-only sentinel is on master. Until then the fallback's 8-minute reset is the only
/// thing throttling a channel that has no conversation identity, so removing it first releases the
/// loop it is masking.
///
/// Phrased this way on purpose. An earlier draft filed the same sentence under "what this does not
/// pin", which reads as *nobody can test this* rather than *this is next, behind a gate* — and a
/// declared gap resting on an unexamined reason is what teaches the next reader to stop looking.
/// That exact confusion cost another session six commits on this repo the same evening.
