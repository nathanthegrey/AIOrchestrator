# self-write-suppression-check.sh — exercises the "your own append is not traffic" rule end to end.
#
# The watcher lives as a bash script inside five markdown role commands, where no C# test can reach
# it. This runs the REAL channel-append.sh against a REAL temp channel and drives a copy of the
# watcher's decision, so the rule that decides whether a session is woken is checked by something
# other than reading it.
#
# The decision function below is a TRANSCRIPTION of `self_write_suppresses` in the role commands.
# Change one and change the other; a copy that drifts is worse than no check, because it certifies
# a rule nobody is running.
#
# IT REFUSES TO RUN IF IT CANNOT FIND THE HELPER. A harness that cannot find what it tests reports
# passes about code it never executed — this repo has already had one do exactly that, 16 confident
# failures about hooks it never invoked.
