# AI Orchestrator — machine setup for macOS and Linux, the twin of install.ps1. Does FOUR things:
# the supervision home and its folders, the aiorch PLUGIN (marketplace + install), the status line
# and its settings.json entry — then the optional Telegram configuration, kept unless you type new
# values. Safe to re-run: the plugin install is idempotent and every copy is content-compared (md5).
# Run from the repo root:  bash kit/install.sh
# The plugin cache is compared to this checkout by CONTENT and REINSTALLED when it differs: `claude
# plugin update` compares the version string only (measured 2026-09-07, CLI 2.1.263).
#
# THE ROLE PROTOCOLS ARE NOT COPIED ANY MORE. kit/ is a Claude Code plugin, installed once from a
# local marketplace pointing at this very checkout, and from then on every session loads it with no
# flag and no copy — which is what ends the four-derived-copies problem of decisions 17, 18 and 23.
# The running host no longer installs it either: it CHECKS the version and refuses to start sessions
# against a kit it was not built for.
# Dependencies: bash, jq (settings.json is merged, never rewritten blind), md5sum or md5, claude.
