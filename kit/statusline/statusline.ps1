# AI Orchestrator status line for Claude Code.
# 1) Renders the session's orchestration role so every terminal is identifiable at a glance:
#      red    SUPERVISOR · <display name, falling back to the orch-id>
#      blue   IMP-N · <display name, falling back to the orch-id>
#      amber  GENERAL SUPERVISOR
#    Falls back to model + cwd for non-orchestrated sessions.
# 2) TELEMETRY PROBE: for orchestrated sessions it dumps the RAW statusline JSON (cost, usage,
#    limits — whatever this Claude Code version provides) into the session's .usage.json, which
#    the orchestrator app reads for per-member cost display and usage-limit Telegram alerts.
# Configured in ~/.claude/settings.json by install.ps1; env vars are set by the spawner.

# THE ORCHESTRATION'S NAME, ON EVERY ORCHESTRATED TERMINAL. The owner, 2026-08-21: *"since it's hard
# to change the terminal name, we should add the topic name to the custom claude status line which
# should be simpler I think"*. They are right, and it is strictly better than the window title this
# replaces in practice: a title is written once at spawn and a running window keeps the old one until
# it respawns, while this is re-rendered every turn, so a rename shows up on the very next line.
#
# It is the same string they read in their topic list, which is the whole point - the terminal and
# the phone name the session identically, so "the one called AI-Orch - away mode loop" means one
# thing in both places.
#
# IT REPLACES THE ID, IT DOES NOT SIT NEXT TO IT. This started life as Get-DisplayNameSuffix, an
# append-only helper, so a named orchestration rendered BOTH: "SUPERVISOR  strategy-lab-7  PB ·
# equity control bug". The owner, 2026-08-24: *"the new name doesn't replace the original unreadable,
# pointless default name like 'strategy-lab-7'. So the status bar gets unnecessarily longer. That
# name should be replaced and the new name should take its place while keeping its color (right now
# it's just being added, and it's white)"*. The id is the fallback, never a prefix to the name.
#
# AND THE COLOUR COMES FROM THE CALLER, which is the other half of what they asked for. The suffix
# carried a hardcoded ESC[97m bright white, and it could not have done better: it took only a root
# and an id, so it never knew whether it was being drawn on a red supervisor line, an orange solo
# one or a blue member one. Returning the bare LABEL puts it inside the caller's own colour run —
# each render line already opens one for the id and closes it after — so the name inherits the role
# colour by construction rather than by a parameter someone has to remember to pass.
#
# Same discipline as the progress suffix below, with the fallback moved: EVERY failure path returns
# the ID and the caller draws exactly the line it drew before names existed. An unnamed
# orchestration, a missing session.json, a half-written one - all of them mean "no name to show",
# never a broken status line and never an empty gap where the id used to be.
