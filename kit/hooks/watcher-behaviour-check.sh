# AI Orchestrator — behaviour check for the WATCHER LOOP shipped inside the role commands.
#
#   bash kit/hooks/watcher-behaviour-check.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-14 the watcher was found to answer "the file changed" when what had
# actually happened was "I could not read the file". Both commands' exit statuses were discarded, so
# a fork that failed produced an empty or partial fingerprint, which compared unequal to the real one
# and fired — one failed read, two phantom wakes, and nothing anywhere recording that a read failed.
# It taxed every session in the orchestration for a day, and it did so hardest on a machine that was
# out of memory, which is when real traffic matters most.
#
# THIS RUNS THE SHIPPED TEXT. It extracts the bash block out of each role command and executes it —
# there is no second copy of the loop here to drift from the one agents are told to arm. Only two
# lines are rewritten, both loop plumbing, and the script REFUSES TO RUN if either rewrite fails to
# apply:
#
#     while true; do   ->   while read -r step; do      (drive it, instead of forever)
#     sleep 5          ->   apply_step "$step"          (a step instead of a wall-clock wait)
#
# so the body under test — read_fp, the failure branch, prev handling, the marker, the blind alarm —
# is byte-for-byte the shipped one. Steps are fed on stdin, so there is no timing in this file and
# nothing here is flaky.
#
# REFUSING TO RUN IS THE POINT. A harness that cannot find what it tests must fail loudly rather than
# report that the thing it never executed is fine: hook-behaviour-check.sh once returned 16 confident
# failures about code it had not run, because nothing-is-ALLOW. Every discovery step below is fatal.

# Pulls the fenced bash block that defines read_fp out of a role command.
#
# The CR strip is EXPLICIT and load-bearing. The role commands are stored CRLF on this machine
# (core.autocrlf=true, no .gitattributes), and the rewrites below anchor on end-of-line — against a
# CRLF line, `do$` does not match `do\r` and every rewrite would silently fail to apply. It currently
# works only because Git-for-Windows awk opens in text mode and drops the CR for us, which is an
# msys quirk this harness must not depend on: on a checkout that kept CRLF into a POSIX awk, the
# extraction would still succeed and the driver would not, and the refusal below is the only reason
# that would be noticed rather than reported as a pass.
