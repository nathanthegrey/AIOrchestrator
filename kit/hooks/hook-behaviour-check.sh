# AI Orchestrator — behaviour check for the supervisor enforcement hooks.
#
# HOW TO RUN:  bash kit/hooks/hook-behaviour-check.sh
# It needs nothing installed, touches nothing outside a temporary HOME it creates and deletes, and
# exits non-zero on the first case that does not match intent.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: these two hooks deadlocked a live supervisor seven times in one evening — the
# PreToolUse hook denied every call while a question was with the owner, and the Stop hook refused to
# end the turn until PLAN.md was written, so the demanded write was the forbidden write. They had no
# coverage at all.
#
# WHY THE FIXTURES ARE BUILT BY PYTHON AND VALIDATED. An earlier version pasted Windows paths
# straight into a JSON string by hand. The backslashes made the payload invalid JSON, python3 threw,
# the hook saw an empty tool name and FAILED OPEN — and "fail open" reads as ALLOW, so the two cases
# asserting ALLOW passed while proving nothing. A reviewer deleted the path normalisation entirely
# and this file stayed green.
#
# That is worse than a thin test: malformed input always yields ALLOW, so ANY future ALLOW case
# written with a Windows path would have been a silent no-op. Three defences now:
#   1. fixtures are serialised by json.dumps, which is what actually CLOSES the class — no escaping
#      is ever hand-rolled, so the bad payload cannot be written in the first place;
#   2. every fixture is parsed before use, and an unparseable one yields a sentinel that no case
#      expects, so it fails the run instead of scoring ALLOW;
#   3. the same for a hook that is missing, crashes, or cannot start.
#
# Defence 2 is stated carefully because it was overstated before. The sentinel used to be swallowed
# by verdict() — which returned ALLOW for anything that was not a denial — so only the one case that
# compares it WITHOUT verdict() could ever see it: the header claimed a guard that covered 1 case of
# 29. verdict() now passes every non-verdict outcome through untouched. A comment that overstates a
# defence is how the next reader stops checking, which is the same defect in prose.
#
# The row that matters most is "ledger behind + question open -> ALLOW". If that ever goes back to
# DENY, a supervisor is stuck until a flag expires.

# A known-DENY probe, run before AND after the PreToolUse block. A TOTAL environment failure is loud
# — every DENY case reddens at once — but a PARTIAL one is not: this machine hit its commit limit
# three times tonight, and a fork that fails for only some invocations leaves the affected ALLOW
# cases passing silently in a sea of green. The probe converts that into a VOID run instead, because
# a suite that cannot evaluate its subject must not report on it.
#
# IT HAS NO PRECONDITION, AND IT MUTATES NOTHING. Both properties were learned the hard way.
#
# The probe used to expect a DENY that the await hook only produces while `.awaiting-answer` is up —
# an UNSTATED precondition, which this file takes down for the cases that follow it. Called after that
# point the probe returned ALLOW and announced "the environment cannot evaluate these hooks": a
# confident wrong diagnosis of a flag it had itself failed to check, in the function whose whole job
# is to stop this suite from lying. Two routes to one state, reported as one cause.
#
# The first fix raised the flag around the probe and restored it. That works and it is the wrong shape:
# an instrument that mutates the state it measures around. Not hypothetical — a mutation run of that
# version removed the raise and kept the restore, so the probe DELETED a flag the suite had raised and
# the entire PreToolUse block went red.
#
# So the probe is now a denial with no precondition anywhere: the reviewer hook refuses a destructive
# verb unconditionally, with no flag, no orchestration folder and no state of any kind. It can be
# called from any point in the file, which is the property that lets it sit after the LAST case.
#
# It is also the better canary. This payload drives the full python reducer — the heaviest path in
# these hooks and the one that actually dies when the machine cannot fork — where the old Write
# payload exercised only the lighter extraction. The probe that missed a dying machine tonight was
# measuring the cheaper thing.

# THE THREE TRAVERSAL CASES ARE DENIED TWICE OVER, and that is written here because it was MEASURED
# rather than assumed. Two mechanisms landed together — the path is normalised, and the remainder
# after the folder must be a bare filename — and EITHER alone refuses these payloads, so neither
# mutation reddens them. Removing BOTH does, which is the run that says they are not passing for some
# third reason nobody has looked at.
#
# The mechanisms are pinned INDIVIDUALLY by two other cases below: the single-dot ALLOW (normalisation
# and only it) and the descend-below DENY (containment and only it). So all five earn their place —
# delete the single-dot case and normalisation is unpinned, delete the descend-below case and
# containment is unpinned, delete these three and rev-6's actual finding is asserted nowhere.
# THE LEFT BOUNDARY. The containment test searched for `supervision/<orch>/<member>/` and checked only
# what came AFTER it, so any directory whose name merely ENDED with the word satisfied it. The fix for
# this exact class was already four lines below, on the baseline clause, with a comment explaining it —
# written in the same change that left this one substring-based.
#
# The test compares SEGMENTS now, so both boundaries close by construction rather than by a guard per
# side. These four cases are one class in four spellings: a longer name before, and a longer name in
# each of the three segments that must match exactly.
