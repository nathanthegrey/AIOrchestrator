# AI Orchestrator — a question STOPS the supervisor, exactly as it does in a terminal.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the supervisor asked the owner a question and then carried on working — briefing
# implementers, running commands, changing state. By the time the owner answered, the answer landed
# against a world that had already moved, and the conversation became incoherent: five questions in
# flight, replies two topics behind, no way to tell which were still live.
#
# Queueing its messages was tried first and was the WRONG fix: it hid the symptom while the
# supervisor kept working. The owner was blunt about it — "this means that the sup is moving in the
# background. This should not happen. The sup should wait for my answer."
#
# So the app raises <orch>/.awaiting-answer the moment a question reaches the owner, and this hook
# refuses every tool call while it is there. The session has nothing left to do but end its turn and
# wait — which is precisely the terminal's behaviour. The app deletes the flag as soon as the owner
# says anything, and expires it after 10 minutes so a silent owner cannot brick the orchestration.
#
# Only supervisor sessions are affected (AIORCH_ROLE is set by the spawner). Any unexpected
# condition ALLOWS the call — an enforcement bug must never wedge a session.

# WHAT THIS BLOCKS, AND WHY IT IS NOT EVERYTHING ANY MORE.
#
# The rule is that the WORLD must not change under an owner who is deciding — not that the session
# must be paralysed. Denying literally every call was measured as harmful on 2026-08-11: it blocked
# reads, it blocked the PLAN.md write that the Stop hook simultaneously demanded (a true deadlock,
# ~20 minutes of a live supervisor producing nothing), and it held a written answer away from an
# implementer that had been idle for eight minutes waiting on it.
#
# So: anything that cannot change the world is allowed, and everything that can is still denied.

# A HOOK THAT CANNOT EVALUATE ITS PREDICATE SAYS SO, AND ALLOWS — see hook-log.sh for both halves.
# Sourced defensively: a missing helper must not be the thing that breaks a session, so the calls
# below degrade to no-ops rather than to failures.
# DEFINED FIRST, UNCONDITIONALLY, then overridden by the real one. The stub used to live in an
# `else`, so it covered a MISSING helper only — a helper that EXISTS but is truncated or empty left
# the function undefined and the call failed to stderr, the stream this feature's own header says
# nobody reads. That window is real rather than theoretical: KitAssets_Installer overwrites
# ~/.claude/hooks at every app start, so a hook firing during that copy sees a partial file.
