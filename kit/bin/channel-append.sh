# channel-append.sh — the ONE way a session appends to a supervision channel.
#
# It exists because "re-read the last header and add one" cannot be made safe by trying harder: the
# window it leaves open IS the write. Two writers who both read [71] both write [72], and a writer
# that emits its entry in more than one write() call gets another author's header dropped into the
# middle of it. Both happened on 2026-08-13, five minutes apart, and the second put a reviewer's
# nine findings under the supervisor's header — an audit trail that misattributes under load is
# worse than one that drops entries, because it is confidently wrong.
#
# WHAT THIS GUARANTEES: writers that use this helper are serialised against every other writer that
# uses it, INCLUDING the app, which takes the same lock from .NET. It cannot bind a writer that does
# not ask. A session can append with a bare redirect and nothing here will stop it — every session
# runs as the same OS user and no location is out of its reach. So the true sentence is "writers
# using the protocol cannot collide with each other", never "channel appends are atomic".
#
# The lock is a DIRECTORY, because mkdir is a single atomic syscall that fails when the target
# exists — the one exclusive-create bash and .NET can both perform without either emulating the
# other. flock was rejected: msys flock and Windows LockFileEx are different mechanisms, and
# assuming msys/Windows equivalence is how this repo has already produced silent failures.
#
# Exit codes are meant to be distinguishable, because "could not acquire" and "wrote it" must never
# look alike to the caller:
#   0  the entry was appended; its index is printed on stdout
#   2  usage error
#   3  COULD NOT ACQUIRE THE LOCK within the budget — nothing was written, retry is the caller's
#   4  an I/O error; nothing was appended

# A SESSION WOKEN BY ITS OWN APPEND RELOADS ITS WHOLE CONTEXT TO LEARN NOTHING, and that was about
# half of every wake on the owner's machine: the watchers fingerprint the channel file, and a
# fingerprint cannot tell whose write changed it. So the writer says so, from inside the lock, where
# the answer is not a guess.
#
# TWO FACTS, because the fingerprint alone would swallow an owner's message. If they wrote at 23:14
# and we appended our own entry at 23:15, the file's fingerprint is still exactly the one our write
# left behind — and a watcher suppressing on that alone would sleep through them. So the record also
# carries the size the channel had when our unbroken run of writes STARTED. A watcher suppresses only
# when the fingerprint matches AND that start is at or before the last size it saw for itself:
# anything foreign in between moves the start past it, and it fires.
#
# The run is EXTENDED rather than restarted while our writes stay consecutive (the previous record's
# size is still the file's size when we take it again), so a session appending twice in one turn is
# not woken by its own second entry. The moment anything else appends, the next write starts a new
# run after it.
#
# Per AUTHOR, never one file per channel: a supervisor and an implementer both watch the implementer's
# channel, and a shared record would let the supervisor's append suppress the IMPLEMENTER's wake —
