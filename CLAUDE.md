# AI Orchestrator — AI Context

## What This Project Is

A portable orchestration kit that generalizes a proven two-agent supervision pattern to N agents, with Telegram as the owner's window into everything.

**The pattern being generalized** (born in the Da-Vinci-Fintech-Suite repo, file `SUPERVISION-CHANNEL.md` on the `portfolio-live-following` worktree — read it for the reference protocol): one SUPERVISOR Claude Code session (expensive model, fresh context, reviews and gates) and one IMPLEMENTER session (cheaper model, writes code) coordinate through an append-only markdown channel file. Each session arms a background file-watcher before ending every turn, so an append by one side wakes the other (duplex, self-waking, no human relay). The owner interfaces only with the supervisor, at high level. It works extremely well; this project productizes it.

**What this repo builds:**
0. **General supervisor** (added 2026-08-06) — an always-on concierge session with its own channel
   (`~/.claude/supervision/general/channel.md`) mirrored to the Telegram supergroup's General topic
   (pinned by the owner). The owner texts it "work on skeleton client" from their phone; it resolves
   the repo and starts/closes whole orchestrations via the request-file protocol below.
1. **Orchestrator app** (this solution) — a desktop control app that owns:
   - The repo list (seeded from the owner's project registry; editable).
   - "Start supervisor" per repo: spawns a Claude Code terminal session (`wt new-tab -d <repo> -- claude "/supervisor <orch-id>"`) and creates the orchestration session.
   - "Add implementer" per orchestration: spawns N implementer terminals, each with its own id (`claude "/implementer <orch-id>/imp-<n>"`).
   - The **Telegram bridge loop** (background, in-process): tails all channel files → mirrors appends to Telegram; long-polls `getUpdates` → routes owner messages into supervisor inbox files.
   - Status: which sessions/orchestrations are alive, last activity per channel.
2. **Claude Code role commands** — `/supervisor <id>` and `/implementer <id>` installed user-level (`~/.claude/commands/`), available in every project. Each loads the full role protocol (channel paths, watcher command, report format, staging discipline).
3. **Installer** — sets up a new machine: prompts for bot token / supergroup chat id / owner user id, writes local config, installs the role commands, seeds the repo list.

## Architecture Decisions (locked so far — brainstorm in progress, spec pending)

1. **Telegram is a MIRROR + owner console, never the agent↔agent transport.** Hard Bot API constraints force this and it is also the better design: bots cannot create group chats (only forum topics), bots never see other bots' messages, and one bot token allows a single concurrent `getUpdates` poller. Agent↔agent traffic stays on local channel files (append-only, auditable, watcher-wakeable — the proven mechanism). The bridge mirrors outbound and injects inbound.
2. **One Telegram forum supergroup, one topic per orchestration session.** The owner creates the supergroup once (Topics enabled, bot as admin); the app creates a topic per orchestration id via `createForumTopic`. Owner messages typed into a topic are inherently supervisor-only, because implementers never read Telegram at all.
3. **Central channel home, outside every git tree:** `~/.claude/supervision/<orch-id>/` containing `session.json` (repo path, member roster + PIDs, telegram topic id), `owner-channel.md` (duplex owner ⇄ supervisor: bridge appends inbound Telegram messages, supervisor appends replies/questions, bridge mirrors the supervisor's entries back to Telegram), `orchestrator.log.jsonl` (structured per-orchestration log), and `imp-<n>/channel.md` (one duplex channel per implementer). This kills the accidental-`git add -A` hazard the in-repo channel file had, and makes bridge discovery trivial (watch one folder; new orch-id folder ⇒ create topic).
4. **Hub-and-spoke topology, one supervisor : N implementers.** Each implementer gets its OWN channel file with the supervisor — an exact copy of the proven 1:1 duplex protocol. Implementers never see each other's traffic. The unified "group conversation" view exists only in the Telegram mirror, where the bridge merges all spokes chronologically tagged `[sup → imp-2]`, `[imp-1 → sup]`, etc.
5. **The app spawns sessions in real terminals** (Windows Terminal `wt new-tab`, fallback `Start-Process`), passing the role slash command as the initial prompt so the session knows its role and id from message one. Mac later via `osascript`; same design, different launcher line.
6. **Portable kit:** everything a new machine needs (app, role commands, config template) installs from this repo (`kit/install.ps1`). Owner uses this across multiple machines.
7. **Request-file protocol (`~/.claude/supervision/.requests/*.json`)** — agents ask, the app executes (~2 s), and confirms with a first-class `FROM app` channel entry that wakes the requester's watcher. Actions: `start-orchestration` (repo only — ids are auto-allocated `repo-slug-n`) + `close-orchestration` (general supervisor), `add-implementer` + `close-implementer` (orchestration supervisors), `set-telegram-muted` (any supervisor — DND). Closing marks `ClosedUtc` in session.json (audit trail kept, tailing stops, UI dims, terminals killed); the orchestration close also closes its Telegram topic. See the spec's AMENDMENT sections.
8. **Lifecycle (spec AMENDMENT 2, revised):** sessions are always-on while the app runs — pid files (written by the spawned shells) + `SessionWatchdog` respawn anything dead (general supervisor auto-starts); app exit tree-kills every session (and closes their terminal windows); app restart brings everything back. **Resume = fresh role-command re-entry for ALL roles, never `--continue`**: the general supervisor is stateless across launches by owner directive (memory = its own CLAUDE.md + the channel read as a LOG — closed/failed requests are never auto-retried on boot; `--continue` once re-ran a failed start and duplicated orchestrations).
9. **DND with catch-up:** mute pauses outbound Telegram by FREEZING tailer offsets — unmute (UI, request, or the owner texting anything) delivers all pending traffic in one burst. The general supervisor's "check-in ritual" (summary digest of all orchestrations + pending questions per topic) is protocol.
10. **Telemetry:** `statusline.ps1` doubles as probe — dumps raw statusline JSON to per-session `.usage.json`; UI shows per-member cost/task/worktree(`WORKTREE:` marker)/time-on-task; engine texts usage-limit alerts at 90/95/97/98/99/100% (schema-tolerant parser — NEEDS LIVE VERIFICATION that this Claude Code version exposes limit data). "Show session" foregrounds a terminal by title (sessions spawn one WT window each, `wt -w new`).
    **Usage figures have ONE reader** (`UsageTotals_Reader`): `Build_PerSourceTotals` is the
    per-session lifetime breakdown and `Build_OrchestrationTotals` is that list summed, so the
    cards, the detail window, `/tokens` and `/cost` can never disagree — and every source passes
    exactly once through the respawn accumulator. `/cost` is the money reading (per-session share
    + burn rate, suppressed under 15 min as meaningless); `/tokens` is the token reading.
11. **~~`/italian` toggles the translation layer~~ — THE TRANSLATION LAYER IS GONE (owner
    decision 2026-09-09).** The app no longer translates anything: the `Translation/` tree, the
    `telegramItalianLayer` key, `Create_WithItalianLayer`, the `/italian` command and the status-bar
    checkbox were all removed. Roles handle languages themselves — with the owner a role writes in
    the language the owner used; files, code, commits, the ledger and every channel entry addressed
    to another agent stay English. Kept switched off the layer was not merely dead: turned back on it
    would have fed already-Italian prose through an English→Italian prompt, and the unchanged text
    coming back reads as a failed translation, so a correct message got stamped with a flag. What
    survives of this decision is the rule it taught, which is decision 14's neighbour: nothing may put
    an output of the outbound pipeline back into its input side.
12. **Channel headers are AGENT-WRITTEN — treat `[n]` and the timestamp as untrusted input.** Both
    are guesses unless the agent re-read the file: on 2026-08-10 `option-lab-2` carried two `[80]`
    and two `[81]` entries, and a supervisor stamped `2026-08-11 01:34` on an entry written at
    `15:20` the day before. The date field drives "time on task", and a future stamp used to render
    as "on task under a minute" indefinitely — through a SECOND copy of the duration wording in
    `SessionRows_Builder` that lacked the negative guard `SessionDuration_Formatter` always had.
    One implementation now (`Describe_SinceStamp_OrNull`, which returns null for a future stamp
    rather than a confident wrong number), and all five role commands require a fresh read for both
    fields. Never add a second copy of a formatter.
13. **Never compare a stored entry COUNT against a later live-file count.** `Channel_Compactor`
    moves older entries into a sibling `.archive.md`, so a live-file count is not monotonic. This
    silently broke "has the supervisor answered the owner yet": `option-lab-2` compacted 2 minutes
    after a delivery, 18 supervisor entries left the live file, and the pending could never clear —
    the owner was told their message was still waiting long after it was answered, and the
    supervisor was nudged for a failure that never happened. Count through
    `ChannelHistory_Counter.Count_Entries_ByAuthor`, which spans live + archive.
14. **Owner-facing repeats EDIT, they never stack.** The busy-supervisor narration used to send a
    new Telegram message every 3 minutes for as long as a turn ran; it now edits one line that
    counts up, like the turn-ended receipt always has. A repeat that is a notification is a
    waterfall, which is the thing this system exists to prevent.
15. **Alerts the owner cannot act on do not go to Telegram** (owner directive 2026-08-10). The
    PLAN.md ledger-shape complaint ("lines that lump several tasks together") now goes only to the
    supervisor's channel and the log — splitting a task line is the supervisor's job, so texting
    the owner about it was pure noise. Apply the same test to any new alert.
16. **Parallel agents: implementers (and solo) fan out, supervisors do not, writers need disjoint
    files.** An implementer's turn is MEANT to block — it is the one doing the work — so the
    supervisor's "never use a sub-agent" rule covers the SUPERVISOR's turn only (that turn is the
    owner's phone line) and is never relayed to a member. Solo gets the same fan-out contract, by
    reference, since it does the work itself with nobody else to hand parallelism to. Read-only
    fan-out is an implementer's default; parallel WRITERS are allowed only on disjoint file sets, with
    git and ambient files (`.csproj`, DI registrations, shared constants) kept to the implementer
    itself — PLAN.md is the supervisor's, never an implementer's to touch. The supervisor PROPOSES
    the split in the brief (`PARALLEL UNITS`) and the implementer verifies it — a supervisor briefs
    lean and has not read the code. A sub-agent's report is NOT evidence: the implementer reads the
    diff and runs the suite before reporting. A new implementer SESSION is for a separately reviewable
    deliverable (own review cycle, worktree, or ledger line); one deliverable going faster is fan-out,
    and ledger lines never shatter into units. Spec:
    `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-implementer-parallel-fanout-design.md`.
17. **The APP is the delivery path for the kit — `install.ps1` is bootstrap only.**
    `AIOrchestrator.csproj` copies `kit/commands/*.md` and the statusline into the app's output
    folder, and `KitAssets_Installer` overwrites `~/.claude/commands` from THAT folder at every
    startup. So editing `kit/commands/` is not delivery: without `dotnet build AIOrchestrator.slnx`
    the next app launch silently reverts every change back to the stale build output. Verify a kit
    change AFTER an app restart, never just after a copy — a `diff` taken between the two reads
    IDENTICAL and means nothing. `kit/install.ps1` is for a fresh machine that has not built yet.
    **And the build must be the MAIN checkout's, never a worktree's:** `dotnet build` inside a
    worktree lands in THAT worktree's output folder, which the running app never reads — so a kit
    change can be edited, built, tested and reported as verified while the app keeps installing the
    old one. Since implementer work happens in worktrees by default, this is the normal case, not the
    exception.
18. **SAY WHICH COPY YOU READ — installed, built, or branch source.** Every file in this system
    exists three times: the branch source (`kit/…`), the app's build output, and the installed copy
    (`~/.claude/commands`, `~/.claude/hooks`). They drift, and a finding about one is not a finding
    about another. On 2026-08-11 this happened FIVE times in one evening, twice to the supervisor:
    "the hooks contain no python3" (true of the installed copy, false of the branch), "the hooks were
    not edited tonight" (installed mtime, branch had six commits), a `diff` between build output and
    main tree that read identical and meant nothing. **State the copy in every report** — it is the
    single cheapest habit here and the one that would have saved that evening.
19. **`python3` on this machine is native WINDOWS Python, not the msys one.** It cannot see msys
    paths: `open('/tmp/x.sh')` throws `FileNotFoundError` on a file `cp` has just created and `bash`
    can read. Anything handing a path from bash to python3 must hand it a Windows path. The failure
    is silent in a heredoc — a script that "ran" wrote nothing, and the two green runs that followed
    were the unmodified original.
20. **A harness that cannot find what it tests must REFUSE TO RUN.** `hook-behaviour-check.sh`
    resolves the hooks relative to its own location, so a copy run from elsewhere finds none of them,
    every invocation returns nothing, and nothing-is-ALLOW: it reported 16 confident failures about
    code it never executed. Same class as the fixture guard — a harness must fail loudly rather than
    certify the absence of the thing it is testing. **And never assert on a state with two routes to
    it:** a case that allows for either of two reasons pins neither, which is how a guard stayed
    green with its check deleted.
21. **Hooks ADVISE, the app ENFORCES at the point of effect.** Every session runs as the same OS user
    as the app, so no filesystem location is beyond its reach — a session can delete a flag, edit the
    hook script, or unwire it from `settings.json`. A guard there restrains an honest session and
    stops nobody else, so the enforcement that must actually hold belongs in the app, where a session
    can only ask. **Corollary: a hook that cannot evaluate its predicate SAYS SO and ALLOWS.** It must
    never invent a denial it cannot justify, and never grant silent consent either — the line goes to
    `orchestrator.log.jsonl` (the app tails it; not Telegram, see 15; not stderr, which nothing
    reads), one appended line naming WHICH predicate failed and why. "Could not extract a tool name
    from the payload" is actionable; "hook error" is the silence again.
22. **THE ENDEAVOUR IS WHAT THE OWNER ASKED FOR — everything else is PARKED** (owner directive
    2026-08-14, after `ai-orchestrator-4`). Every session that reads code finds problems in it, and
    those discoveries were becoming work: the horizon exploded, orchestrations *"took an eternity to
    reach objectives and also forgot to carry out tasks that were explicitly requested"*. That
    session's PLAN.md ended with 40+ heading sections of findings and rulings, and three branches
    were left unmerged with twenty worktrees open. **A ledger line must trace to an OWNER REQUEST
    row**; anything else goes as one line into PLAN.md's `## PARKED` section — written down so it is
    not lost, outside the denominator so it cannot move the owner's bar. Two admissions only: it
    BLOCKS a requested line (then it is part of that line, not a new one), or it is live damage,
    which goes to the OWNER as a question. **Cheapness is never the argument** — the cost of a
    discovery is not its fix, it is the horizon it opens. Per decision 21 the app enforces the half
    it can: `PlanLedger_Parser` skips the sections named by `PlanLedger_Sections`, so a parked item
    cannot inflate the bar even written with a `- [ ]` marker. Reviewers separate findings from
    `OUT OF SCOPE` by PROVENANCE, not severity; implementers report `NOTICED (not fixed)`.

23. **THE RUNNING APP IS A FOURTH COPY — check `Get-Process AIOrchestrator | Select Path` BEFORE
    believing anything you built is live.** Decision 18 names three copies (branch source, build
    output, installed). There is a fourth and it is the only one whose behaviour the owner is
    describing when they report a bug: on 2026-08-21 the app was running from
    `AIOrchestrator\bin\Debug - Copia\net10.0-windows\AIOrchestrator.exe` — a manual copy, so the
    owner can rebuild while it runs — while every `dotnet build` that session wrote to `bin\Debug\`.
    Three fixes were merged, pushed, and reported as delivered; none of them were running, and the
    live DLL still contained `Rename_TelegramTopic_FireAndForget`, which the merge had deleted. A
    green build and a clean `git log` say NOTHING about what the owner is using.
    **This also feeds the kit:** `KitAssets_Installer` installs `~/.claude/commands` from the
    RUNNING app's output folder, so a stale copy keeps reinstalling stale role commands at every
    startup — which is why the installed `supervisor.md` can stay old through any number of correct
    builds. **To read a running binary** (metadata names are UTF-8, string literals are UTF-16LE —
    an ASCII `grep` returns confident false negatives): search the DLL for
    `"Some_Method_Name".encode('utf-8')` and `"a literal".encode('utf-16-le')`.

## Resolved Decisions (2026-08-06, owner)

- **UI framework: WPF** ("keep it simple") — `net10.0-windows`. The suite's `LoggingLib` ships a WPF `ListBoxLoggerSimple` control, which the app uses as its live log panel.
- **Coding patterns: follow the suite's `CODING_PATTERNS.md`** (read `CODING_PATTERNS_QUICKREF.md` in the suite repo before writing C# here). `AIOrchestratorCoreLib` = strict (triples, factories, immutability); the WPF app project = UI-relaxed (mutable observable properties allowed), same as the suite's App-project rule. NOTE: this repo has no pre-write hook — compliance is on the author.
- **Suite code reuse — RETIRED for now (2026-08-06 live-fix):** v1 referenced the suite's `LoggingLib` for its `ListBoxLoggerSimple` log panel, but that control is hard-designed light (white root background, pastel per-tag rows baked into its template) and cannot be dark-themed from outside; the app now ships its own dark log view (`Views/LogRowView` + `ActivityLogListBox`). **The repo currently builds standalone — no suite checkout required.** Coding patterns still follow the suite's `CODING_PATTERNS.md`; if suite libs are reused later, reference the MAIN checkout at `..\..\manuelvene90\Da-Vinci-Fintech-Suite` (never a worktree).
- **Per-orchestration logging + live state view** (owner directive mid-design): every orchestration writes `orchestrator.log.jsonl`; the app shows a live log panel and per-member state chips (implementer working / awaiting review / writing window open / blocked on owner) derived from the channel files.
- **Dual interaction:** Telegram AND direct terminal typing are both first-class; the file protocol works with the app closed.

## Design Spec

**`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-ai-orchestrator-design.md` is the approved design** — read it before changing architecture. This file stays the quick context; the spec is the authority.

## Repository Structure

```
AIOrchestrator.slnx        ← solution (repo root = solution level)
AIOrchestrator/            ← the desktop app project (currently the raw VS template)
CLAUDE.md                  ← this file
docs/superpowers/specs/    ← design specs (pending)
```

## Conventions

- The repo root is `C:\Users\Gianpiero\source\repos\AIOrchestrator` (solution level), not the inner project folder.
- Machine-local secrets (bot token, chat ids) live in gitignored `*.local.json` / `secrets.json` — never committed, never hard-coded.
- Multi-line git commits via `git commit -F <tempfile>` (Windows PowerShell mangles `-m` with here-strings).
