# stage/8d — the six points of brief C the owner had already decided

**Date:** 2026-09-10 · **Branch:** `stage/8d-pulse-glyphs-and-the-general-bar`, branched from `ours/integration` at `6429cd9` (8a+8b+8c landed, plus the other agent's 9a/9b/10). · **Brief:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-09-telegram-briefs-A-B-C.md`, brief C — the **Decisions** and **Done-when** sections.

**OWNER REQUEST (2026-09-10):** *"C is not done. These six were DECIDED by the owner on 2026-09-09 (brief C, Decisions and Done-when), so they are in scope, not behaviour calls."*

Stage 8c delivered brief C's body and **parked six items as behaviour calls**. That was the wrong reading: all six are written down in the brief the owner had already approved. This branch closes them. The one genuine ambiguity in the list — how far "topic-name glyphs reduced to ❓ ⏸ 🏁" went — was put to the owner as a single question and answered the same day; their ruling is quoted in point 2 below.

**Language:** every string here is **English**, owner-facing ones included (their rule of 2026-09-09: *"if the strings are hardcoded, English; the rule holds"*). Decision 11 governs what a ROLE writes.

## The six

| # | What was wrong | What it does now |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **PULSE re-posted whenever it was buried**, changed or not. A quiet orchestration says the same thing minute after minute, so every pause in a talkative topic bought a delete plus a post carrying no news — the surface breaking its own promise, since PULSE exists so that status costs no notifications. | The repost **rides on the decider** instead of overriding it: "something new to say" is `Decide() != None`, which already answers None for identical text and for blank text. One rule, not a second comparison. |
| 2 | **Topic-name glyphs.** Nine glyphs competed for the front of every topic name, and two of them — ✈ away and 🤐 quiet — are **app-wide**, so one toggle renamed every open topic at once and each rename writes a service message into the thread it renames. | The name keeps what is about the **work or the owner**: ❓, ⏸ (paused for a usage limit), 🏁 (closed), plus the two the owner sets by hand, 🧪 and ✅. Every **mode** glyph moved to PULSE's header: 🌙 🔕 ✈ 🤐 💻. ⛔ folded into ❓ ("same meaning for the owner"). The ledger recap gave 🏁 up and took 🎯. |
| 3 | **General's command bar was built, unit-tested, and never rendered** — `Build_ForGeneral` had no production caller at all — and three of its five commands had no case in the tap handler. | The dashboard is sent and edited through the **row-aware** calls, so the bar rides on it exactly as the topic bar rides on PULSE. `/summary`, `/resume` and `/dnd_all` call the same code the typed commands call. |
| 4 | **DND froze everything**, including the two surfaces that make no sound. The owner's check-in ritual — "show me where everything stands" — was reading a PULSE and a dashboard frozen at the moment the mute went on. | 🌙 holds only what rings. The two silent surfaces run before the DND return; everything else stays held. **Deferred and Silenced part company**: 🌙 keeps content and replays it, 🔕 drops it, so a status surface stays current under one and out of the way under the other. |
| 5 | **PULSE field 4 paired a clock with a subject from a different event** — the subject was the newest member-spoke entry, the clock was the supervisor's last owner-channel stamp. `last · 10:00 · <the implementer's subject>`: two true facts, one false sentence. | The picker returns the winning entry's subject **and its stamp** as one `TopicLastEvent`. `LastEventAt` is deleted from `TopicStatusFields` rather than left unused — keeping it would keep the bug available. |
| 6 | **"Once per question" was keyed on the agent-written `[n]`** — the one number in this system that must never be an identity (decision 12). | Keyed on a hash of **author + subject + body** via the existing `ChannelEntry_Digest`. Deliberately not `RawText`, which carries the header and would key on the index through the back door. |

## Why 5 and 6 were invisible

Neither was a wrong line of code; both were two right halves that were never asserted together.

- Field 4's clock was **entirely untested** — `grep LastEventAt` across the test project returned nothing — because no test ever set it, so the pair could not be compared. The fix makes the pairing structural: one argument, so there is no second one left to fill from a second file.
- The stall-alert key produced **two silent failures, each looking like the other's fix**: on a duplicate index (`option-lab-2` carried two `[80]` and two `[81]` in one evening) two different questions shared one key and the second was never alerted about at all; across a compaction that renumbered an entry, the same question earned a second alert.

## Probes

Unit, on the pure decision surfaces (the engine is `internal sealed` with no `InternalsVisibleTo`, so anything decided inside it is unreachable from the suite — the reason these classes exist):

- `TheRepostDoesNotFireWhenTheTextHasNotChanged` — the retired claim, kept under an inverted name
- `BuriedAndUnchangedStaysPut_BuriedAndChangedMovesOnce` — the brief's own probe, including the third call that proves a changed line moves **once** and not on every later tick
- `AfterARestartNothingIsRepostedUntilRealTrafficIsSeen` — the pair of in-memory blind spots that cover each other
- `ADeferredTopicIsStillPostedInto_Silently`, `ADeferredTopicStillMovesItsLine_Silently`, `ASilencedTopicIsNotPostedInto`, `ASilencedTopicIsNotRepostedIntoAndFallsBackToTheEdit`
- `TheLastFieldsClockIsTheClockOfTheEventItNames`, `AnEventWhoseStampCannotBeReadPrintsNoClock`
- `TwoQuestionsSharingAnIndexAreTwoQuestions_AndOneQuestionRenumberedIsStillOne`
- `EveryButton_HasACaseInTheTapHandler` / `EveryButton_IsKnownToTheCommandLexer`, now walking **both** bars

**Mutation-checked, every one**: the gate forced true (1); either mode gate widened back to `!= Normal` (4); the clock sourced from a different member's entry, which is the original defect exactly (5); the key returned as the index again (6); a renamed `case` (3).

### The guard that was green over three dead buttons

`EveryTopicButtonIsWired` walked `TopicCommandButtons.Commands` and never `GeneralCommands`, so `/summary`, `/resume` and `/dnd_all` sat with no case in the switch under a green suite. It had also never been possible to notice by hand, because the bar was never drawn — nobody can tap a button that is not there. A guard reporting "every button wired" over a list it had never read is decision 20's harness, in the file written to prevent it. It walks both lists now, concatenated rather than duplicated, so a third bar is covered by construction.

## Not in this branch

- **`Push_PeriodicStatus_Async` is still misnamed** — there is no periodic status any more. A rename touching every call site is not one of the six.
- **The dead code 8c parked** (`_lastPostedProgressByOrchId`, `Should_SendHandoffLine`, `Build_BusyHandoffLine_OrNull`, the orphaned `Channel` / `Age_Everything` test helpers) stays parked.
- **An unreadable member state file can still log on every tick.**
- **~100 test fixtures delete their temp tree unguarded**, any of which can hit the macOS teardown race `TempTree` was written for; only the fixture that actually failed uses it.
- **`⛔`'s constant is kept** though nothing draws it, so `Strip_Glyph` can take it off names an older build wrote. Every currently-blocked topic is wearing one.
