/// entries are emitted only when COMPLETE: a following header proves completion immediately; the
/// trailing entry is emitted only once the file has stopped growing for
/// <see cref="ChannelTailer_Factory.TRAILING_ENTRY_QUIET_MILLISECONDS"/> — a DURATION, never a count
/// of polls, because how often the loop polls is the mirror loop's latency decision and moving it
/// must not move this (it did, on 2026-09-09; see that constant).
/// <para>
/// Emission is AT-LEAST-ONCE, by contract: entries stay emitted-but-unconfirmed until the caller
/// calls <see cref="Confirm_Append"/>, and every poll re-emits whatever is still unconfirmed. A
/// caller that never confirms therefore sees the same entries again — which is the point. Before
/// this, the offset advanced during the read and a failed Telegram send dropped the owner's
/// messages for good, with nothing but a log line to say so.
