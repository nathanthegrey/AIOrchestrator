/// <summary>
/// HOW MANY TIMES THE TICK TOUCHED THE DISK. Every counter here is incremented at a real syscall —
/// the read of a session.json, the read of a channel file, the write of the bridge cursor, the
/// append of a turn-log line — and nowhere else.
///
/// <para>
/// IT IS A SEAM FOR TESTS, NOT TELEMETRY, and the distinction is the reason it exists at all. The
/// waste this measures is repetition inside one 2-second tick: the same file read twenty-four times
/// because twenty-four callers each asked the disk. That is invisible to every assertion a test can
/// otherwise make — the ANSWERS are identical whether they came from one read or from twenty-four —
/// so a test that pins "read once per tick" has to count the reads. A log line would not do: it
/// cannot be asserted on, and per CLAUDE.md decision 15 nobody can act on it either.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// COUNTING IS NOT FREE OF MEANING WHEN IT IS WRONG. A counter incremented at a call site that does
/// not actually open a file, or missing from one that does, turns a green test into a false clearance
/// for the exact defect it claims to pin. So each counter names ONE syscall and is incremented
/// immediately beside it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// THE COUNTS ARE PER-FLOW, NOT PROCESS-WIDE, and that is not a refinement — a process-wide counter
/// is unusable for the assertions this exists for. xUnit runs test collections in parallel, and half
/// the suite reads channel files; an absolute count taken from a static would carry every other
/// class's reads and the assertion would fail for reasons that have nothing to do with its subject
/// (the same defect <c>CHANNEL_LOCK_COLLECTION</c> documents for the lock's process-wide sink).
/// <see cref="Begin_Scope"/> opens a counter on the CALLING async flow; the scope object is inherited
/// by every task and thread started under it — which is how a scope opened by a test before
/// <c>Run_Async</c> counts the syscalls a mirror tick makes on its own loop — and is invisible to any
/// flow that did not open one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// AN UNSCOPED FLOW IS COUNTED NOWHERE. There is deliberately no process-wide total behind these:
/// nothing in the app reads a count, so keeping one would be a number no one can act on and one more
/// thing to keep true. In production every increment here is a null check and a branch not taken.
