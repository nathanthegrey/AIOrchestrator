/// WHAT A CLOSING MEMBER'S SPOKE STILL HAD PENDING, SAID OUT LOUD BEFORE IT STOPS BEING A SOURCE.
///
/// <para>
/// Closing a member is <c>Close_Member</c> plus a kill: no drain, no read of the spoke. From that
/// moment <c>TurnSources_Resolver</c> skips the channel, so an entry the supervisor was never handed
/// is never handed over — and because the cursor is deliberately kept, it is not re-delivered either.
/// Nothing was lost from the FILE, and nothing is re-run; what is lost is that anybody knows.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// THE EXPOSURE WAS ONE TICK AND IS NOW A DIGEST WINDOW. Before the member digest (2026-09-09) an
/// ordinary report was handed over on the next tick, so the gap between "filed" and "delivered" was
/// seconds; a held report now waits up to <c>printRunner.memberDigestMinutes</c>. The re-review of
/// that change measured the widening and called it unacceptable as shipped, for the right reason: the
/// entry most likely to be in flight when a supervisor closes a member is the member's LAST one —
/// "done, pushed, here is the diff and the suite output" — and the supervisor may then close a ledger
/// line whose evidence it never read.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A LINE, NOT A DRAIN. Draining the spoke would mean running one more supervisor turn inside a close,
/// which is the close deciding to spend a turn nobody asked for; and the honest half of the problem is
/// not the delivery, it is the silence. So this says what is being dropped, to the log the app tails —
/// never to Telegram, which decision 15 reserves for what the owner can act on, and this is the
/// supervisor's own decision taking effect. When it cannot answer, it says which read failed rather
/// than inventing a verdict (decision 21).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// "PENDING" IS NOT A MEASUREMENT WHILE A TURN IS IN FLIGHT — measured in production 2026-09-10, the
/// first time this line ever fired, and it was FALSE. <c>imp-3</c> filed entry [72] ("Done. F1 closed,
/// origin/dev merged, all gates re-run") at 14:06:13; the digest released it at 14:11:15 and the
/// supervisor turn started carrying it; this said at 14:12:43 that the supervisor "was never handed"
/// [72]; that turn ended in success at 14:12:58. The cursor advances beside
/// <c>Advance_Cursors</c> — i.e. when a turn COMPLETES — so for the whole of a turn's run the entries
/// it is delivering still read as pending. So the pending set alone cannot answer this, and the
/// caller passes what the dispatcher alone knows: the identities the in-flight turn is carrying.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// AND THE ANSWER IS A CONDITIONAL, NOT A SUPPRESSION. An in-flight turn that FAILS leaves its
/// entries pending, and the member is gone by then — so hiding the line whenever a turn is in flight
/// would trade a false alarm for a silent drop. Entries nothing is carrying are a WARNING (they are
/// being left behind, full stop); entries a turn is carrying are an INFO naming the condition, which
/// is what the caller distinguishes with <c>AnythingDropped</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It lives here rather than in <c>BridgeEngineModel</c> because that file takes no new lines by
/// inertia (`.claude/rules/code-conventions.md`): the engine keeps the one call.
