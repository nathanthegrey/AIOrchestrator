/// THE LOG USED TO ASSERT SOMETHING IT HAD NOT LOOKED UP. A lapsed read-back window logged
/// "nothing was taken, and the question is still open" unconditionally — the sweep never read the
/// open-question registry. On 2026-09-09 at ~16:03Z that line was written about a question that had
/// already been stamped closed minutes earlier, so the one record of the event told a reader the
/// opposite of the truth and pointed them at a question they would not find.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// SO THE REASON IS REMEMBERED WHERE THE CLOSURE HAPPENS, and it is a fixed vocabulary rather than
/// free text: a reader comparing two log lines a week apart must not have to decide whether "closed
/// by the owner" and "answered by message" are the same event.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// AN UNRECORDED CLOSURE IS SAID OUT LOUD TOO. The reasons live in memory only — they are a
/// diagnostic, not state anything acts on — so a closure that happened before a restart is named as
/// exactly that, never guessed at and never silently reported as "still open" again.
