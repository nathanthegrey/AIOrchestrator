/// Decides when the owner has stopped reading, so the orchestrations can stop talking AT them.
///
/// WHY: the owner spent a day on a plane and landed to a wall of messages, several of them
/// multi-select questions, with no way to tell which were still relevant. Unanswerable spam is
/// worse than silence — it costs them work before they can do any.
///
/// THREE STATES, because two were not enough (owner's catch): "what if I got sent 100 questions in
/// 15 minutes?" A single 15-minute timer lets the flood happen and only THEN reacts.
///
///   NORMAL → QUIET   at the 3rd unanswered message, IMMEDIATELY. That orchestration stops asking.
///                    It is a suspicion, not a conclusion: the owner may be 30 seconds from
///                    replying, so nothing is announced and nothing is parked yet.
///   QUIET  → AWAY    once the owner has been silent EVERYWHERE for 15 minutes. Now it is a
///                    conclusion: announced, questions parked, short updates begin.
///   → NORMAL         the instant the owner says anything anywhere.
///
/// AWAY IS APP-WIDE, never per orchestration. The owner is either at their phone or not; they are
/// not "present for crm-2 and absent for arb-1". The clock therefore runs on their LAST MESSAGE
/// ANYWHERE — chatting in one topic proves presence for all of them — and the app coordinates every
/// orchestration directly rather than having supervisors relay it to each other (owner's call).
