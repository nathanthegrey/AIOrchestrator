/// swallowed into a log line, and nothing written down anywhere. A delete that failed therefore left
/// an orphan topic on the owner's phone with no record that it should not be there — and the owner's
/// decision, recorded in the same brief, is that topics ARE deleted (they will have thousands, and a
/// list full of finished ones is noise). A delete nobody retries is that decision not being kept.
