/// their pending entries re-run from scratch after the 60-second backoff: roughly 14 hours of work
/// discarded. Those turns were WORKING — 32 to 92 tool calls, 7 to 30 M input tokens — not hung; a
/// hung process is caught much earlier and much cheaper by the silence limit. Raising the deadline
/// was refused (a longer turn is a bigger context, which is the bill this stage exists to cut), so
/// the killed transcript is resumed ONCE for long enough to say where it got to, and the next turn
