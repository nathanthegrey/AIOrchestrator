/// MEASURED ON THE VPS, 6–9 Sep 2026: an orchestration supervisor was woken ~400 times in the window,
/// 247 of them by MEMBER traffic, at 2.5 model calls and a mean 398 k of context per call — one
/// wake-up is on the order of 1 M input tokens, and 15 % of those turns produced less than 600 output
/// tokens (an acknowledgement). The supervisor is the most expensive role in the system and the last
/// one still resuming a transcript, so cutting the NUMBER of its wake-ups is the one large saving
/// available without touching its memory. Spec §C4 of

/// THE RULE IN THREE LINES. The owner wakes it now. A member's ordinary report waits for the digest —
/// at most <c>IRunnerConfigs.MemberDigestWindow</c>, so several members' reports ride ONE turn instead
/// of buying one each. The app's own bookkeeping never wakes it and cannot reach this at all
/// (<see cref="PrintTurn_Trigger.Is_Inbound"/> excludes <see cref="ChannelAuthors.App"/>, so a

/// digest, and a member's answer to the owner cannot be delayed by one: the entry that would carry it
