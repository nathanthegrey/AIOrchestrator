/// THE QUEUE IS THE CHANNELS. A bridge-driven session has no process to hold a queue in, so its
/// pending work is defined by the files: every inbound entry of every channel it is woken by whose
/// identity is not yet in that channel's cursor is pending, and one turn takes all of them. That gives
/// FIFO per session, coalescing (entries that land within the window ride together, ACROSS channels),
/// and restart recovery (a bridge that died mid-turn finds the same entries pending) without a queue
/// object anywhere.
///
/// Per tick, per registered session: resolve its channels, read them, select the pending entries, wait
/// out the coalesce window, then start ONE turn on a background task — never more than one per session,
/// never more than the global and per-orchestration slots allow. The task runs the process, writes the
/// session's entries from the result — each part into the channel it was addressed to — records a
/// <c>turn_ended</c> entry, and persists the cursors. A failed attempt (timeout, non-zero exit,
/// <c>is_error</c>) is counted and retried after a backoff under the SAME request id; at
/// <see cref="MAX_ATTEMPTS"/> the session stalls — an alert entry, no further attempts — until the
/// pending set changes. ONE FAILURE IS NOT AN ATTEMPT: a usage-limit refusal that names its reset
/// buys an appointment instead (<see cref="Record_UsageLimit_IfNamed"/>), because three tries a
/// minute apart cannot outlast a quota window and spending them on one leaves the session with
/// nothing left when it reopens.
///
/// Idempotency: a request id already in the executed list is skipped without running. The prompt
/// of the first resumed turn after a bridge start lists the executed turns, so a transcript that
/// remembers answering does not answer twice (decision 8).
///
/// The slot limits are read ONCE, at construction — a semaphore cannot be resized — so changing
/// them in config.json takes effect at the next app start. Everything else (runner, resume mode,
/// timeout, coalesce window) is read on every tick.
///
/// <para>

/// <see cref="ITurnExecutor"/>, picked per role from the configured runner. Everything above stays
