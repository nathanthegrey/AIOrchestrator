/// How long a request must wait before Telegram will accept it — the rate limit, in ONE place.

/// <para>
/// WHY ONE PLACE. Telegram allows roughly twenty messages a minute to a group, and this app edits
/// topic names every tick, posts a status line per orchestration, mirrors channel appends and
/// answers commands. Handling the limit per feature is how it was handled: <see cref="TelegramAttempt_Gate"/>
/// classifies a 429 into an unknown outcome and backs that ONE caller off, the busy-supervisor
/// narration reads the same 429 and does the opposite thing, and every other send has no opinion at
/// all. The result is that a burst from any one of them spends the allowance of all the others,
/// invisibly, and the feature that gets the 429 is whichever happened to go last.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A BUCKET, NOT A SLEEP BETWEEN SENDS. A fixed delay would cap the steady rate and still let a cold
/// start fire twenty messages in one second; a bucket lets a quiet minute pay for a burst, which is
/// exactly the traffic shape here — silence, then a catch-up burst when the owner unmutes.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// PURE, so the rule can be tested at any speed without a network or a clock. The state is two
/// numbers the caller carries; the caller is <see cref="TelegramApiClient.TelegramApiClientModel"/>,
/// which is the single choke point every Telegram method already goes through.
