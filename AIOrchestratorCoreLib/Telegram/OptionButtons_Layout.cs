/// WHY THIS EXISTS — the owner, 2026-08-24: *"buttons don't wrap, so when a session asks me a
/// question I often can't read all the button text."* An agent writes `OPTION:` lines and the app
/// hangs one inline button per option off the question message, the button's label being the whole
/// option text. Telegram does NOT wrap a button label: it cuts it and puts an ellipsis on the end.
/// So two thorough options that differ only in their second half arrive on the phone as two buttons
/// reading the same thing, and the owner cannot tell what they are choosing between — the one tap
/// in this system that cannot be taken back.
///
/// THE FIX: when an option is too long to read on a button, the FULL texts move into the message
/// body as a numbered list — the body is ordinary text, and text wraps — and the buttons keep only
/// the numbers. The number on the button then points at a line the owner can actually read.
///
/// WHEN EVERY OPTION IS ALREADY SHORT, NOTHING CHANGES. Today's behaviour is good in that case, and
/// a numbered list under a question with two three-word answers would be ceremony around nothing.
/// That path is pinned by a test so a later tidy-up cannot quietly make numbering unconditional.
///
/// ALL-OR-NOTHING NUMBERING. Once one option needs the treatment, every option is numbered, not just
/// the long ones: a keyboard mixing "1) rebase onto ma…" with "cancel" reads as two different kinds
/// of button and hides which list line "cancel" corresponds to. Uniform is worse for nobody.
///
/// PURE, AND INDEX-FAITHFUL. The caller registers the callback payload for option[i] against
/// label[i], so this never reorders, never deduplicates and never drops an entry — the output count
/// always equals the input count. A "helpful" dedupe here would silently rewire the owner's tap to
/// the wrong answer.
