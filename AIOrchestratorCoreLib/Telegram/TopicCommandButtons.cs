/// The owner's frequently-used commands, as permanent tappable buttons on a topic's status line.
///
/// They render as an INLINE keyboard hanging off that message — one tap sends a callback_data
/// payload back to the app, leaving no message in the chat. The set lives HERE, once, and both the
/// rendering and the parser derive from <see cref="TOPIC_BUTTONS"/> and
/// <see cref="GENERAL_BUTTONS"/>, so adding a command is one line in one array and cannot leave a
/// button that renders and does nothing.
///
/// TWO BARS SINCE 2026-09-09, because the two kinds of topic answer different questions. An
/// orchestration topic is about ONE endeavour — what is waiting, what is left, what is it doing,
/// merge it, end it. The General topic is about ALL of them, so it gets the cross-cutting five
/// (/summary, /pending, /limits, /resume, /dnd_all) and none of the per-orchestration ones, which
/// would have no session to act on there.
///
/// THERE WAS A SECOND RENDERING, AND IT WAS REMOVED ON 2026-09-06: a persistent REPLY keyboard, the
/// bar of literal slash commands above the input box, installed by sending a carrier message and
/// deleting it again. IT NEVER WORKED. Telegram anchors a reply keyboard to the message that
/// delivered it, so deleting that message takes the bar with it — measured on the owner's phone,
/// send then delete, bar appears then vanishes on the same chat. The bar had only ever been SEEN
/// when the process was killed between the send and the delete, leaving the carrier alive by
/// accident; in normal operation the feature spent every launch sending a message, buzzing the
/// owner's phone, and ending with the chat exactly as it started. Keeping it working would have
/// cost a permanent junk line in General, for five commands already one tap away here and listed
/// in the "/" menu besides. Do not reintroduce it without re-measuring that premise first.
///
/// Callback data is prefixed "cmd:" so a tap cannot be confused with the other button families
/// already flying around this bridge: "hold:"/"go:" (<see cref="HoldButton_Data"/>),
/// "close-yes-{guid}"/"close-no-{guid}" (the close confirmation), and "opt-{n}" (the single-use
/// option registry). <see cref="Parse_OrNull"/> returns null for every one of those, because a tap
/// this class cannot read must fall THROUGH to the next handler untouched. Swallowing it as a
/// malformed command would eat the owner's answer to a question — the one tap in this system that
/// cannot be repeated.
///
/// Like the hold toggle, and unlike the question options, these buttons are deliberately NOT
/// registered in the single-use registry. They are permanent furniture: the owner presses /pending a
/// dozen times across a session, and expiring the button after the first press would leave dead
/// furniture sitting exactly where they were told to press.
