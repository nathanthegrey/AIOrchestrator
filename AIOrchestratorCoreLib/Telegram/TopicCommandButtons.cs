/// The owner's frequently-used commands, as permanent tappable buttons in a topic.
///
/// They appear in TWO places at once, and that is the whole reason this class exists:
///   1. an INLINE keyboard hanging off the topic's status-line message — one tap sends a
///      callback_data payload back to the app, with no message in the chat;
///   2. a persistent REPLY keyboard sitting above the input box — one tap sends the button's TEXT
///      as an ordinary message, exactly as if the owner had typed it.
///
/// Two renderings and one tap handler is three places to forget a command, and the failure mode is
/// silent: a button that renders and does nothing, or worse, a bar above the keyboard offering a
/// verb the lexer no longer knows. So the set lives HERE, once, and both renderings plus the parser
/// are derived from <see cref="BUTTONS"/> — adding a fifth command is one line in one array.
///
/// The two renderings carry different strings for the same command, and neither is decoration:
///   - the inline label is read by a HUMAN on a phone, so it gets an emoji and stays short;
///   - the reply-keyboard text is read by the app's COMMAND LEXER, because Telegram sends a reply
///     button's text verbatim as a message. It must therefore be exactly "/show", "/merge",
///     "/test", "/screen" — an emoji there would arrive as part of the message and the lexer would
///     not recognise the command.
///
/// Callback data is prefixed "cmd:" so a tap cannot be confused with the other button families
/// already flying around this bridge: "hold:"/"go:" (<see cref="HoldButton_Data"/>),
/// "close-yes-{guid}"/"close-no-{guid}" (the close confirmation), and "opt-{n}" (the single-use
/// option registry). <see cref="Parse_OrNull"/> returns null for every one of those, because a tap
/// this class cannot read must fall THROUGH to the next handler untouched. Swallowing it as a
/// malformed command would eat the owner's answer to a question — the one tap in this system that
/// cannot be repeated.
///
/// Like the hold toggle, and unlike the question options, these buttons are deliberately NOT
/// registered in the single-use registry. They are permanent furniture: the owner presses /show a
/// dozen times across a session, and expiring the button after the first press would leave dead
/// furniture sitting exactly where they were told to press.
