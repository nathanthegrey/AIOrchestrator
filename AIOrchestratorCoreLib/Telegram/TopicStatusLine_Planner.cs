/// WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is not tidiness. `BridgeEngineModel` is `internal sealed` with no
/// `InternalsVisibleTo`, and the test project references CoreLib alone — so anything decided inside
/// the engine is unreachable from the suite. That is not a theory: a reviewer deleted the trusted
/// stamp reader, the per-topic delivery gate and the backoff gate ALL AT ONCE and the suite stayed
/// green, then proved the build was real by injecting a syntax error into the same file and watching
/// it fail. The green was necessary, not observed.
///
/// The seam was available as `InternalsVisibleTo` and was refused deliberately: it would make the
/// engine testable without making it tested. Moving the two error predicates out is what made them
/// pinned, so the same move is applied to the gates and to the wiring that activates them.
///
/// The wiring is the subtle half. Passing a derived `bool` let a mutation hand the builder `false`
/// with nothing reddening — the fix rested on an argument no test could see. The planner takes the
/// MESSAGE ID itself and derives the flag here, so there is no boolean at the call site to get wrong.
