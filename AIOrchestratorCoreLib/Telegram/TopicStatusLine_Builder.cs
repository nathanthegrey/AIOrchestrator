/// The one message per Telegram topic — and since 2026-09-09 the ONLY status surface a topic has.
/// It is EDITED in place while it is the last thing in the topic, so it never notifies; when later
/// traffic buries it and the topic then goes quiet for two minutes it is deleted and written again at
/// the bottom, because Telegram cannot move a message and the owner wants the current state to be
/// what they see on entering the chat.
///
/// THE PERIODIC STATUS MESSAGE IS GONE (owner decision 2026-09-09) and that is why this class grew
/// four fields. Two recurring surfaces meant the owner read the same orchestration twice in two
/// vocabularies, half an hour apart; the half-hourly one also NOTIFIED, which is the waterfall this
/// system exists to prevent. Everything the digest was for now has to be answerable here, in SIX
/// fields the owner specified in order: what is waiting on them, what the supervisor says it is
/// doing, who is live and on what, the last real event, how much is merged, and when this line was
/// last drawn.
///
/// NOT PINNED, and the owner's reason for refusing that is the reason this file exists at all.
/// "Working now" elsewhere in the app is FILE MTIME, which stays true for ~2 minutes after a turn
/// ends; pinned, that wrong state would sit in front of them permanently. So this line contains NO
/// MTIME ANYWHERE. Every word of it comes from parsed channel state, the PLAN.md ledger, and facts
/// the app knows for certain (a usage-limit pause) — things an agent actually wrote or the app
/// measured — and a member with nothing to report reads "standing by" rather than being described by
/// how recently its file was touched.
///
/// Being an EDIT rather than a message is what makes it safe to keep CURRENT: a repeat that is a
/// notification is a waterfall. The repost is the one exception and it is bounded by the quiet
/// window — every message resets it, so at most one notification arrives per quiet period, and never
