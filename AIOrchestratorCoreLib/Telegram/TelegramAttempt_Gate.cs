/// <summary>
/// The two decisions the topic-name sync makes — WHAT an attempt told us, and WHETHER to attempt now.
///
/// HERE RATHER THAN IN THE ENGINE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS FILE EXISTS. `BridgeEngineModel` is
/// `internal sealed` with no `InternalsVisibleTo`, so every decision taken inside it is invisible to the
/// suite. <see cref="TopicStatusLine_Planner"/> records what that costs: a reviewer deleted the trusted
/// stamp reader, the per-topic delivery gate and the backoff gate all at once and the suite stayed
/// green. The seam was available as `InternalsVisibleTo` and was refused deliberately, because it "would
/// make the engine testable without making it tested". Moving the DECISION out is what makes it pinned;
/// the I/O stays where it is.
///
/// What remains unpinned is the one-line call from the engine to these methods. That is stated rather
/// than hidden — a green suite here says these rules are right, not that they are wired up.
///
/// UNASSERTED, NOT UNTESTABLE, AND THE DIFFERENCE MATTERS. An earlier version of this said the wiring
/// "cannot be observed by any test", which is wrong and was repeated into a commit message before it was
/// checked. `BridgeEngine_Factory.Create` is PUBLIC and takes interfaces only, and five test files
/// already drive the engine end to end — `OwnerAnswerSurvivesFailedSendTests`,
/// `CloseImplementerGuardProbeTests` and the three nudge probes. What is unreachable is the engine's
/// INTERNAL METHODS; its BEHAVIOUR is reachable, at the cost of a slow probe.
///
/// So the honest statement is that nothing asserts this wiring today and a probe could. "Untestable" is
/// the word that stops anyone trying, which is why it is corrected here rather than left standing.
///
/// SHARED BY TWO CALL SITES WITH OPPOSITE CONSEQUENCES. `Classify_Failure` is also used by the
/// busy-supervisor narration, which asks the same question — did the transport fail — and then does the
/// opposite thing with the answer: it decides whether to DISCARD stored message ids, where this file's
/// caller decides whether to SUPPRESS RETRIES. The classification is single on purpose and the actions
/// are deliberately not.
///
/// THE NAME NOW MATCHES THE CONTENTS. It was `TopicNameSync_Gate` — named for its FIRST caller —
/// while the classifier is about Telegram transport failures generally and is used by the
/// busy-supervisor narration and the topic-delete decider too. Its own summary called that "a real
/// wart" and left the rename to a reviewer who wanted one; this is that rename (2026-09-10), and
/// nothing about the rules moved with it.
