/// The one wording, and the one brush key, for a member's declared state. Both were in the WPF

/// engine — which CLAUDE.md item 12 forbids and which this repo has already paid for once, when a
/// second copy of a duration formatter lacked the guard the first one had.
///
/// The move here is not tidiness, it is EVIDENCE. `dotnet test` never compiles the WPF project, so a
/// switch living there is unreachable by the suite: adding <see cref="MemberStates.StandingBy"/>
/// left three of these throwing on the happy path and 484 tests stayed green. Anything that must
/// enumerate this enum belongs where the suite can see it, and
/// MemberStateDescriptorTests walks every value so the next member added cannot pass unhandled.
///
/// No WPF types cross this boundary: the brush KEY is a string the view resolves itself.
