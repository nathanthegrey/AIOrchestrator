/// WHICH QUESTION THE OWNER STILL OWES AN ANSWER TO — the entry itself, or none.
///
/// <para>
/// WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY. The rule was "the session spoke last, so the owner owes a reply",
/// and the ⚠️ stall alert was built on it. On 2026-09-09 that produced, on the owner's phone:
/// *"⚠️ … has been waiting on your reply for 25 min"* at 17:30 — thirty minutes after the
/// supervisor had written **"Nothing more needed from you"** — then again at 18:38, when the
/// supervisor was not waiting for anything but PAUSED for a usage limit, and again at 20:25. On a
/// second topic, three more. Every one of them was false, and each was indistinguishable from a real
/// one, which is what makes a false alert expensive: it teaches the owner to ignore the true ones.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// THE OWNER'S RULING, 2026-09-09: the alert fires *"only when the supervisor's last owner-channel
/// entry is a real question (`QUESTION:` block or `BLOCKED ON OWNER`), once per question"*. "The
/// session spoke last" is not a debt — a supervisor reporting progress, saying goodnight, or saying
/// that nothing is needed has asked for nothing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// IT RETURNS THE ENTRY, not a bool, and that is the "once per question" half of the ruling: the
/// caller remembers WHICH question it has already alerted about, so a second alert needs a second
/// question rather than merely more silence. A bool could only ever be re-armed by traffic, which is
/// how the old alert managed to fire three times about the same nothing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// IT RETURNED THE `[n]` UNTIL 2026-09-10, which was the owner's own first wording — and it is the
/// one number in this system that must never be an identity. The header index is written by the
/// agent and is a guess unless the writer re-read the file: `option-lab-2` carried two `[80]` and
/// two `[81]` entries in one evening (decision 12). Two different questions sharing an index made
/// the second one silent — the alert fires ONCE per key, and they had one key — and a question
/// re-indexed by a compaction became a "new" question and bought a second alert about the same debt.
/// Both failures are silent, and both are the exact shape of the noise brief C exists to remove.
/// The key is now <see cref="Identify_Question"/>: what the entry SAYS, and who said it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// APP ENTRIES ARE SKIPPED, unchanged from the rule this replaces: the app is not a participant in
/// this conversation, and it writes precisely when someone has been waiting. Counting one as the
/// last word let the app's own status push silence the alert — a feature quietly disabling itself.
