/// Their ask, 2026-08-20: *"It's quite difficult to follow the sup's or solo's work. I think that I
/// should receive a very short and fast message every time it completes a member of the progress
/// ledger and starts a new one."* Between the half-hourly digest and a full /progress there was
/// nothing that said "this just moved", so following a session meant asking it.
///
/// IT COMPARES TWO READINGS AND REPORTS THE DIFFERENCE, which is what keeps it from becoming the
/// thing this repo spent a whole day removing. A transition happens once, so it is told once: no
/// timer, no cadence, nothing that can fire twice for the same event. The engine's memory of the
/// last reading is the only state involved.
///
/// TOP-LEVEL LINES ONLY. Sub-tasks are the altitude /tasks reports; announcing each one would turn
/// a stage with eleven pieces into eleven messages, which is the waterfall by another name.
///
/// MATCHED ON THE LINE'S TEXT, not its position. A ledger is hand-written and lines get inserted
/// above others all the time; an index-based comparison would report every line below an insertion
/// as having changed.
