/// <para>
/// PLAN.md STAYS THE EXECUTION LEDGER. This is not a replacement for it and cannot become one: the
/// sections, the markers, the turn-end hook and the owner's progress bar are unchanged, and a
/// backend that vanishes leaves an orchestration that still runs exactly as it did. What a backend
/// adds is a synchronisation of ONE section — <c>## OWNER REQUESTS</c>, the table of what the owner
/// asked for — in both directions: an approved request upstream becomes a row here, and a row
/// finishing here is reported upstream. <c>## PARKED</c> is never synchronised: a discovery nobody
/// asked for is local by definition (decision 22).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// THE DEFAULT IMPLEMENTATION DOES NOTHING, and that is the contract's most important property. See
/// <see cref="PlanMdBackend"/>: it lists no requests and reports nothing, so an installation that
/// configures no backend behaves byte for byte as it did before this interface existed.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// IDEMPOTENCE IS DEFENDED ON BOTH SIDES. The app persists what it has already ingested and already
/// reported (see <see cref="PlanBackend_StateStore"/>), so a restart, a re-read of the same ledger,
/// or the same transition seen on two consecutive ticks produce ONE call — that is the defence at
/// the point of effect (decision 21). An implementation must still be idempotent for a repeated
/// <paramref name="requestId"/> or ledger row reference, because the app's state file is written
/// AFTER the call and a process killed in between will retry: at-least-once is what the wire
/// guarantees, exactly-once is what the two sides together deliver.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// IMPLEMENTATIONS LIVE OUTSIDE THIS REPOSITORY. One is loaded by name from config.json (see
/// <see cref="PlanBackend_Loader"/>), so nothing here knows what a particular planning system is
/// called, speaks its protocol, or depends on it being reachable. Every method must therefore be
/// safe to call on a tick loop: a slow or throwing implementation costs its orchestration this
/// tick's synchronisation and nothing else.
